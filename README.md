# Project Title: JARVIS â€“ Intelligent Personal Assistant MVP

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an intelligent personal assistant inspired by **J.A.R.V.I.S.** from the Iron Man series. The system will integrate real-time internet connectivity, voice interaction, and optional facial recognition capabilities to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Core Features
- **Voice Assistance**  
  Natural language processing (NLP) and speech-to-text/text-to-speech systems for hands-free interaction.

- **Real-Time Internet Integration**  
  Ability to fetch real-time data such as weather updates, news, emails, calendar events, and more.

- **Task Execution**  
  Control system-level operations such as opening applications, managing files, setting reminders, and more via voice commands.

- **Facial Recognition (Optional)**  
  User authentication and personalization through facial recognition using computer vision.

- **Extensibility**  
  Modular design to support integration with smart home devices, APIs, and third-party services.


## Objective
To build a robust prototype of an AI-based personal assistant capable of responding to user queries, executing tasks, and interacting through natural human-like communication, paving the way toward a full-fledged autonomous assistant system.
